This was our final week in Stat 157. On Thursday, Carl and Sam posed an intervention for the class, in which we candidly discussed our thoughts, expectations, and lessons from the class. It was an extremely effective class period, in which each subgroup broke off to individually discuss what they have gained from the class. One thing that my group and I emphasized was the idea of working collaboratively. A majority of our classes rely on individual work, and in general group projects are something that I dread because of the inevitable unequal distribution of work. This class definitely reoriented my interpretation of collaboration; although the distribution of work has continued to be uneven, my approach to group work has changed completely. I think in every group situation, one person must naturally emerge as a leader. This isn't an assigned position or a position that is formally defined, but one that forms due to an individual's dedication and big-picture vision for the overarching goal. I think this is what happened in Statistics 157, and it is what has helped drive the class to a certain extent.

As we are preparing for the Data Science Fair, it is important to think about how reproducibility and collaboration is important in science, and this course has definitely helped us see that.
