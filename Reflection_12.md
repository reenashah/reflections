This week, we utilized classtime to coordinate among our groups. On Tuesday, we were able to Skype with Luen, who provided us with a lot of information regarding his thesis on the Earthquake data. It was very useful to hear his explanation of the data. He helped visualize the data, and after talking with him for an hour, I feel like I understand the material and the mathematical interpretation better.

I was actually sick on Thursday, and so I was unable to make it to class. I met with my group on Sunday to receive updates on what is occurring in the class. From group discussions, we concluded that groups seem to work best when there is some sort of a timeline given to them. For the remainder of the semester, it may be helpful to create more specific goals for the class. One roadblock that we may encounter in the next coming weeks is organization of ideas; because there are so many different groups working on various problems, it may prove to be difficult to coordinate among different results.
