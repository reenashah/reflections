Reflection 5 - October 5, 2013.

This reflection is a bit late because my group and I were working in Aaron's Office Hours for three hours this afternoon.

This week we were assigned our first project: using the Questionnaire Data that we filled out in the beginning of the course to analyze two columns. We were assigned new groups to work with in order to complete the project and present on Tuesday. I liked the discussion of "horizontal" and "vertical" groups; we were assigned "vertical" groups of 4, where each member has a specific role to contribute to the project. We also have "horizontal" groups, which includes all of the, say, visualizers, of all the groups. The horizontal groups allow us to collaborate in terms of different ideas we may have for the project, and implement them in a way that is specific to the work product our vertical group is working on.

I think that my vertical group works well together; we all seem to be at different levels, but are open to communicating with and helping each other out. There also seems to be a certain level of enthusiasm in our group that keeps the work interesting and fun. On the other hand, I get a different vibe from my horizontal group. Maybe it's because the size of the group is so large, or maybe it is because of another reason, but the horizontal group (at least for the visualizers) has a completely different tone. Only a handful of people are even responding to the questions and comments posed in the email thread. When we constructed 2 minute presentations in class last week, again only 2-3 people contributed to the discussion. Others complained that they were confused or that they didn't know what was going on, but didn't do anything to show an interest in the work. No one volunteered to present to the class or even help me write words on the chalkboard while I presented. Granted, this was only one interaction with the team, and perhaps over time once the horizontal groups work more together, we will be able to effectively function together.

In terms of working on the actual presentation, today my group (Group 11) went into Aaron's Office Hours for over three hours. We discussed everything that was on our mind - from the purpose of using a Virtual Machine to going through the necessary steps to access iPython Notebook through our browser. I think these kinds of meetings with the professor are helpful, not only for the actual information and concrete help we receive, but also to confirm that we are on the right track in the way we are approaching this project and this class in general. It's reassuring to talk through some of the sources of confusion. I can now officially use iPython Notebook and access the Questionnaire data through the Google API! I've also looked up different ways of graphing data in Python. 

We also talked about the idea that perfection is our enemy. Especially for a first iteration, it is unnecessary to aim for 100% accuracy when we are extracting the data. The time that it will take to acheive this will not be worth a 2% increased accuracy. This makes our life a bit easier for the project; we don't have to worry about being 100% accurate, and can thus use simple regular expressions and pattern mining to analyze the data without worrying about missing something.

I'm really excited to see where this project takes us - I'm ready to dive into the data and make a great product.
