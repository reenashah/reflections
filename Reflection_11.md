I chose to write my reflection on Sunday after our leadership group meeting.

Today we updated our SMART goals for our group evaluation. We are still waiting for roles to be assigned to us in response to our individual evaluations. Our group is working on different tasks - helping other groups, verifying code, and creating summary documents from Luen's Paper and Chris' Presentation on Thursday to give out to the class, as we discussed with Danielle and Kristina on Thursday.

We were also discussing potentially meeting with Aaron again sometime soon to develop another task list to be sent out the the various groups. I sensed a return of chaos and confusion in class last week, and I again would like to emphasize the need for explicit direction in order to keep the class on the right track. While some groups are doing an excellent job of being organized, others I feel are a bit lost and seem to need an extra push. 

I think it is crucial, especially for our December 12 presentation and our presentation for Professor Stark, for the entire class to understand conceptually what the earthquake model is illustrating, as well as to understand the math behind it. I think that should be the next major step for the class.
