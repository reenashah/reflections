###Reflection 6

This past week was the busiest Stat 157 week since the beginning of the semester. We were to present our iPython Notebooks to the class on Tuesday, and there was a lot to get done. My group started working on the project on Friday, and the data curator and analyzer worked hard to interpret the data. I felt incredibly lost in the process, since most of my teammembers are much more familiar with these technologies than I am. I was shy to admit it at first, but I did not know what iPython Notebook even was, let alone how to access it through a virtual machine, run Python code, and create a reproducible presentation. My group members were extremely accomodative and willing to help, but even then, I couldn't help but feel as if I was the roadblock in my group's progress with my constant questions and misinterpretations. 

I spoke with Professor Culich extensively this week - my group spent 3 hours on Saturday discussing the project with him, and I spent two hours with him on Monday as he guided me through how to approach the project. His demeanor is calm and understanding; he continuously emphasizes that perfection is the enemy, that he is not looking for the "best" or the "prettiest". Rather, he is interested in helping students go through the process of creating a reproducible presentation and identifying roadblocks early on so as to prevent repetition of mistakes. Although I understand the importance of making mistakes and learning from my peers, this is one of the few times where I feel as if I am behind the rest of my peers. Typically when I am confused in a course, I can simply pick up a textbook and grasp the concepts on my own. However, in this case, I am compelled to rely on my peers and the internet for sources of advice - which is new and foregin and scary.

In the end, however, my group was able to "git push" the project before the deadline and present to the class on Tuesday. Professor Culich seemed satisfied with our presentation. And although it stressed me out and made me recognize my technical shortcomings, I know there are mistakes I made the first time around that I will not make again for the next project. This project epitomized the concept of "learning by doing" - through the process was not a piece of cake, I think that by diving into the project and falling on my own, I was able to gain a fuller appreciation for the technologies we are using and the idea of reproducibility. I also now know what iPython Notebook is! 

It was also really interesting to watch other groups' presentations and witness how they decided to approach the problem in terms of their visuals and group dynamics. On Thursday, we discussed as a class the plus' and deltas of each group's dynamics, and how that drove each group to produce their ultimate results. Nearly every group mentioned "collaboration" and "willingness to help" among team members. This emphasizes my observations earler: we must stop being afraid to ask for help and learn from our peers! I'm glad that I'm learning this early on. 

It was mentioned in class that our next project will be due in two weeks. This time around, I know what I should be careful about, which approaches I should take to tackle the project, and what I can do differently. Above all, I know one this for sure: start early! :)
