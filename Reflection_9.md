###Reflection 9

This week's goal was to carve out sub-problems for the project and establish smaller groups to tackle some of these problems. We began by working in our horizontal groups. I am part of the Visualizer Group, so we spent a significant amount of class time talking about the different goals for visualization that need to be accomplished to acheive the final product. It was helpful discussing with other members in the team what sorts of goals we have in mind regarding how to produce visualizations for the report.

One roadblack that we encountered is that many people in the group have not completed the preliminary steps necessary before we can go forward with the project - namely, reading Professor Stark's papers and understanding what problem we are trying to solve. Because few people in the Visualizers Group have taken the time to understand what we are doing, I found that we spend a lot of time answering basic questions ("What are supposed to be doing?" "Can we get more specific tasks?") or people who simply do not contribute to the conversation. Although this is frustrating, it made the process of consolidating a smaller group much easier - I knew exactly which individuals I would enjoy working with (the ones who have been on top of their work), and I am quite confident with my new vertical group now. It seems that we all are dedicated to the class and are willing to spend time outside of class to gain a better understanding of the problem, go to office hours, and learn the necessary technologies. 

Next Tuesday, our group needs to present to the class a rough outline of what we have accomplished. I am confident that my group will pull together this weekend and forge a helpful discussion regarding what tasks need to be accomplished.

Additionally, today (this Saturday), my new vertical group initiated a lunch meeting so that we can get more familiar with each other on a personal level since we will be working closely together for the rest of the semester. Tim, Tristan, David, and I took a trip to El Cerrito and had a satisfying Dim Sum lunch while discussing the course and the goals we have for the class. The lunch was extremely successful - we developed a more intimiate connection, and we have a very good flow of communication in our group as a result of this lunch. I feel extremely comfortable wtih my group now, and I am actually looking forward to working with them since we have established similarities both academically and personally.
