This week, there was a significant shift in the direction of the class. Last weekend, my group and I posted a list of tasks for each group to tackle and present on Tuesday. This signifncatly changed many students' commitment to the class. As soon as the list was posted, GitHub activity significantly increased. Students began to post questions, share observations, and take the project aspect of the class more seriously.

My group and I had a meeting wtih Aaron and Danielle before class on Tuesday, in which we discussed ways we can improve the focus of the class. We all expected the Tuesday presentations to be a, I quote Aaron "shit show." However, we were all pleasantly surprised by the effort that students had taken over the weekend. The presentations were solid - we were on schedule, the groups seemed to have a focus, and we had finished the initial data curation part of the entire project.

On Thursday, we allowed students to meet in their groups again. I decided to help out one Visualer Group, since my data curation group is done with our tasks. They seemed to lack direction and didn't know where to start, so I managed the group on Thursday and helped them access the original raw data so that they could initialize their project.

One thing I noticed from this group is that they seemed to be so caught up in the details of the project (how to format the graphs, which colors to use, etc) that they were inhibiting themselves from making tangible progress on their roles (such as the basic step of accessing the data in the first place). After some guidance and making sure that everyone was staying focused, the group seems to have their raw data accessed on their computer. I think now the group is at a good starting point to begin working with the data and producing results.

This group has integrated me into their main group, and I am happy to help them out in terms of direction and focus. However, I still think it's important for the leadership group to work on making sure that all teams are focused and in the right direction. The class has definitely taken an amazing turn for the better this week, and I'm positive that the leadership team can do more to not only improve the organization of the class, but also acheive the desired results by the end of the semester.
