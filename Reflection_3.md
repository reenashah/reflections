This week's lectures in Stat 157 took a sharp turn. On Tuesday, we had the privilege of hearing Eric Berlow come to class and discuss his work in the field of ecology. It was intriguing hearing the statistical implications of such a field. Eric's lecture on toads in Yosemite National Park helped bridge the gap between the theoretical statistics that we learn in class and its applications in interdisciplinary fields. He talked about important issues that he ran into while spearheading his project, including lack of data and sampling gaps, among numerous others. It was interesting to hear about the difficulties in conducting statistical experiments in the real world, and how that may potentially affect the quality of the results gathered.

Profesor Stark talked to us on Thursday to discuss his earthquake project. His lecture differed from Eric's in that he spent a significant amount of the time discussing the theoretical statistical interpretations. It was nice to see how different formulas, models, and distributions can be used to simulate a natural process. 

The lectures this week were an excellent exposure to moving beyond the textbook in statistics. However, I still feel a bit lost in terms of what is expected of us in the class as students, and where the class is going to go from here. It seems that now we have the software necessary and an appropriate introduction to interdisciplinary applications, and we are ready to get some hands-on experience.
