###Reflection 8

This week in Stat 157 was an "off" week, meaning that our groups were not presenting a project, but rather learning more about the next project that we are working on and attempting to grasp a more familiar understanding of the class project that we are going to get started on. 

First, we received a survey which allowed us to provide feedback regarding the class, the groups we are working with, and any questions/concerns we may have. It was reassuring to see that individual group contributions were being accounted for, so that people who may not have been making as much of an effort as others have an incentive to work harder. During this survey, it was also brought to my attention that I knew very few people in my horizontal (visualizer) group. Professor Culich emphasized the importance of the horizontal groups - it is helpful to communicate with them in order to create a better understanding of how we will approach the project. It may be helpful in the future to coordinate communication with my horizontal group. 

On Thursday, it was mentioned that we were to work with our horizontal groups in order to create some sort of a product to present the Tuesday after next. The class ended on a bit of a confusing note - it seems that few people in my horizontal group have an idea of what to do. Unfortunately, it has proved to be quite difficult maintaining contact with 12 individuals. Professor Culich strongly emphasized meeting with him in office hours in order to gain a more solid understanding of what we are to do. Again, this timeline unfortunately does not work with everyone; people seem to have busy weekends, and not everyone is in Berkeley and is able to meet. I think it will prove to be a challenge to work with such a large horizontal group, especially since we are finding it difficult to communicate.
